You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and textual description of UI screenshots (variable: {screenshots_data}) for the add-to-cart process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the add to cart process based on the provided html_data and textual description of UI screenshots (variable: {screenshots_data}).
URL: http://max/
Rules:
- Search for a book using the search box and submit the search.
- The success notification must be visible and contain a link to the cart.
- Confirm success by checking that the cart contains at least one item.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
