You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and textual description of UI screenshots (variable: {screenshots_data}) for the product filter process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the product filter process based on the provided html_data and textual description of UI screenshots (variable: {screenshots_data}).
URL: http://max/
Test scenario:
1. Open the home page.
2. Click on the "Search" link.
3. Enter "book" in the search field and submit the search.
4. Wait for the search results to load.
5. Locate and interact with the price range slider:
   - Adjust the minimum or maximum slider handle to set a specific range (e.g. 0â€“25).
   - Wait for the filtering to apply dynamically.
6. Confirm that:
   - The product grid updates after slider movement.
   - At least one product is shown in the filtered results.

Rules:
- Perform a product search using the query "book".
- Apply a price filter by navigating to a URL that includes the price parameter.
- You must use slider interaction (drag handles) to apply the price filter.
- Confirm success by checking that the resulting product grid is updated.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
- Use presence_of_element_located to locate elements. Use visibility checks only when needed.
- Avoid hardcoded XPath text. Always derive selectors and conditions from html_data.
Return only Python code using unittest.
