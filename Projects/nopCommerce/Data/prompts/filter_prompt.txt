You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structures and UI screenshots for the **product filtering** process.

html_data: {html_data}

Base URL: "http://localhost/"

Your task is to generate a valid, importable Python test using `unittest` and `selenium` that tests product filtering functionality based ONLY on elements and selectors from the provided html_data.

Test constraints and structure:

1. The test must simulate a user searching for products (e.g., typing a keyword), then applying a filter such as price range, category, checkbox, or tag — only if such filters exist in html_data.
2. The test must locate and interact with filter UI elements (sliders, checkboxes, input fields, etc.) using selectors explicitly found in html_data. If none exist, skip interaction with that filter type.
3. Use `WebDriverWait` to ensure elements are interactable before interacting.
4. Log meaningful steps like:
   - "Searching for 'book'"
   - "Applying price filter 10–20"
   - "Verifying product list updated"
5. After applying a filter, assert that filtered products match expected criteria (e.g., price within range).
6. If product list is dynamic, wait for it to update before verifying.
7. Use at least two screenshots (before/after filtering) if screenshots_data is provided, to visually confirm UI change.
8. Log actual vs expected results clearly if assertions fail (e.g., "Expected 3 products, found 5").
9. If a filter doesn't respond, retry interaction up to 3 times with short delays before failing.

Test structure:

- Use `unittest.TestCase`
- Include `setUp()` to open browser and navigate to "http://max/"
- Include `tearDown()` to close browser
- No top-level execution code unless guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":`
- All logic must be within class methods

Avoid:
- Using invented or assumed selectors not present in html_data
- Using hardcoded waits (`time.sleep`)
- Using direct test method calls

Return only the valid and complete Python test code.
