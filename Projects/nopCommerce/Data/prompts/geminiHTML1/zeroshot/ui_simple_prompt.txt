You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots of website.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for verifying that the key UI elements of the page are present and visible, based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
home: http://max/
login_page: http://max/login?returnUrl=%2F
register_page: http://max/register?returnUrl=%2F
search_page: http://max/search

Rules:
- Check that the main UI components are present: headers, buttons, links, form fields, etc.
- Check that these elements exist and are visible.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
