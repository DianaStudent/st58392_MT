You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structure 
and a textual description of UI screenshots for the 'addtocart-medium' process.

html_data: {html_data}

screenshots_description: {screen_description}

Task:
Generate a Python Selenium test that strictly follows the described process using only elements from the HTML structure and visual layout.
URL: http://max/
Search term: book
Test scenario:
1. Open the homepage.
2. Click on the "Search" link in the top navigation.
3. Enter "book" in the search field and submit the search.
4. On the search results page, locate the first product and click "Add to cart".
5. Wait for the success notification to appear.
6. Click the "shopping cart" link inside the notification.
7. Confirm success by checking that the cart page contains the added product.

Rules:
- The success notification must be visible and contain a link to the cart.
- Confirm success by checking that the cart contains at least one item.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
