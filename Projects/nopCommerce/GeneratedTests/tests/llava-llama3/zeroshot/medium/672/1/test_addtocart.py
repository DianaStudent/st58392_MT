This test uses webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver and WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements. It uses unittest with setUp() and tearDown() methods, and the testAddToCart method follows the described process using only elements from the HTML structure and visual layout.

The testAddToCart method starts by opening the homepage (Step 1), clicking on the search link to navigate to the search page (Step 2), entering "book" in the search field and submitting the search (Step 3), waiting for the success notification to appear (Step 4), and then navigating to the cart page by clicking the cart link inside the notification (Step 5).

The testCart method confirms success by checking that the cart page contains the added product (Step 6). The is_product_in_cart() method checks if a product named "Test Pro Book" has been added to the cart. It uses WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.

The setUp() method in the testAddToCart class initializes the webdriver and navigates to the homepage, while the tearDown() method at the end cleans up the webdriver session. The is_product_in_cart() method returns True if a product named "Test Pro Book" has been added to the cart and False otherwise.
