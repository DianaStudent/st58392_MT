This test uses Selenium WebDriver with Chrome as the browser. It logs in using the provided email and password, and then confirms that a "Log out" button is present in the top navigation.

If any required element is missing, such as the login form or the "Log out" button, the test will fail with the assertion `self.fail(...)`.

Note that this is just one possible implementation of the task, and there could be other ways to achieve the same result.
