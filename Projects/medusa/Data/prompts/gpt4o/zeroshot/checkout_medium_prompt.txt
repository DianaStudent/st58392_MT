You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the add-to-cart process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the checkout process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost:8000/dk
Test scenario:
1. Open home page.
2. Click on the menu button.
3. Click on the "Store" link.
4. Click on a product image (thumbnail).
5. Select a size.
6. Click the "Add to Cart" button.
7. Click the cart button to open the cart.
8. Click "Go to checkout", fill checkout fields:
 - First name: user
 - Last name: test
 - Address: street 1
 - Postal code: LV-1021
 - City: Riga
 - Country: Denmark
 - Email: user@test.com
9. Select delivery and payment methods.
10. Click "Place Order".
11. Verify the confirmation page contains: "Your order was placed successfully"

Rules:
- After adding a product to the cart, the test must click on the cart button (shopping bag) - Wait for presence of "GO TO CHECKOUT" button using html_data.
- Fill required checkout fields (e.g. email, phone, shipping address, Shipping, payment).
- After placing the order, the test must confirm that the final success page contains the text: "Your order was placed successfully".
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
