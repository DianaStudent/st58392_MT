You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the user registration process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the user registration process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost:8000/dk
Credentials:
First name: user
Last name: test
Email: dynamically generated
Password: testuser
Test scenario:
1. Open the homepage.
2. Click the "Account" button in the right left corner.
3. Click the "Join Us" button below the login form.
4. Fill in all fields: first name, last name, and password from credentials, generate unique email.
5. Submit the registration form.
6. Verify registration success by checking presence of welcome message "Hello user".
Rules:
- Fill all fields for registration from credentials.
- Confirm success by checking that the welcome message "Hello user" is present.
- When locating elements, always prefer using data-testid attributes if they exist in html_data
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
- Use presence_of_element_located to locate elements. Use visibility checks only when needed.
- Avoid hardcoded XPath text. Always derive selectors and conditions from html_data.
Return only Python code using unittest.
