Rules:
- After adding a product to the cart, the test must click on the cart button (shopping bag) - Wait for presence of "GO TO CHECKOUT" button using html_data.
- Fill required checkout fields (e.g. email, phone, shipping address, Shipping, payment).
- After placing the order, the test must confirm that the final success page contains the text: "Your order was placed successfully".
- When locating elements, always prefer using data-testid attributes if they exist in html_data
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
