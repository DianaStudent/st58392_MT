You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structure 
and a textual description of UI screenshots for the 'addtocart-simple' process.

html_data: {html_data}

screenshots_description: {screen_description}

Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the add to cart process based on the provided html_data.
URL: http://localhost:8000/dk
Rules:
- After adding a product to the cart, the test must click on the cart button (shopping bag) - Wait for presence of "GO TO CHECKOUT" button using html_data. Its presence is success.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
