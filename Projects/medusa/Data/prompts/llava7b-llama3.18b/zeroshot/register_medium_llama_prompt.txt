You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structure 
and a textual description of UI screenshots for the 'register-medium' process.

html_data: {html_data}

screenshots_description: {screen_description}

Task:
Generate a Python Selenium test that strictly follows the described process using only elements from the HTML structure and visual layout.
URL: http://localhost:8000/dk
Credentials:
First name: user
Last name: test
Email: dynamically generated
Password: testuser
Test scenario:
1. Open the homepage.
2. Click the "Account" link.
3. Click the "Join Us" button.
4. Fill in all fields: first name, last name, email (generate it unique), password.
5. Submit the registration form.
6. Verify registration success by checking presence of welcome message.
Rules:
- Fill all fields for registration from credentials.
- Confirm success by checking that the welcome message is present.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
