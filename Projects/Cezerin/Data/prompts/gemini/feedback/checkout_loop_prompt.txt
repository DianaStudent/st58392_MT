You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the checkout process.
Below is a dataset containing:
- HTML structure
- UI screenshots
- Previously generated Python test code
- Error traceback from the last test run
Task:
Fix or regenerate the Python Selenium unittest test for the checkout process using the provided information - fix errors based on error traceback.
html_data: {html_data}
previous_code: {previous_code}
error_traceback: {error_message}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the checkout process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost:3000/
Test scenario:
1. Open home page.
2. Click on product category.
3. Select the first product.
4. Click the "Add to cart" button.
5. Click the cart icon/button to open the shopping bag. 
6. Verify that the "GO TO CHECKOUT" button is present inside the cart.
7. Click the "GO TO CHECKOUT" button.
8. Wait for the checkout form to appear.
9. Fill out the checkout form fields using the following credentials:
   - Email: mail@mail.com
   - Phone: 12345678
   - State: Riga
   - City: Riga
10. Select a shipping method and a payment method.
11. Click the "Next" button.
12. Click the "Place Order" button.
13. Wait for the confirmation page and check that it includes the text "Thanks for your order!".

Rules:
- The test must explicitly click the shopping cart icon (usually a bag image with class "cart-button") to open the mini-cart. Do not assume it opens automatically.
- After adding a product to the cart, the test must click on the cart button (shopping bag) - Wait for presence of "GO TO CHECKOUT" button using html_data. Its presence is success.
- Fill required checkout fields (e.g. email, phone, shipping address, Shipping, payment).
- After placing the order, the test must confirm that the final success page contains the text: "Thanks for your order!".
- Fill required checkout fields (e.g. email, phone, shipping address, Shipping, payment).
- After placing the order, the test must confirm that the final success page contains the text: "Thanks for your order!".
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Do not hardcode visible text like "Category A" or "Product A" â€” use exact text or href values from html_data.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
