You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structure 
and  for the 'ui' process.

html_data: {html_data}

Task:
Generate a Python Selenium test that strictly follows the described process using only elements from the HTML structure .
home category_a category_a_1 Test scenario:
1. Load the page and ensure that structural elements (e.g., header, footer, navigation) are visible.
2. Check the presence and visibility of input fields, buttons, labels, and sections.
3. Interact with key UI elements (e.g., click buttons).
4. Confirm that the UI reacts visually.
5. Assert that no required UI element is missing.
Rules:
- Check that the main UI components are present: headers, buttons, links, form fields, etc.
- Check that these elements exist and are visible.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
