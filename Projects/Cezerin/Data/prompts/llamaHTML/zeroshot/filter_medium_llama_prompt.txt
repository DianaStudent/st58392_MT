You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structure 
and  for the 'filter' process.

html_data: {html_data}

Task:
Generate a Python Selenium test that strictly follows the described process using only elements from the HTML structure .
Test scenario:
1. Open the category page.
2. Locate and apply the "Brand A" checkbox filter.
3. Wait 2 seconds to allow the UI to update.
4. Verify that the number of displayed product cards changes (e.g., 2 → 1).
5. Uncheck the "Brand A" filter.
6. Verify that the original number of product cards is restored (e.g., 1 → 2).
7. Locate the price slider component.
8. Move one of the slider handles to apply a price range filter.
9. Verify that the product count changes again.
Rules:
- Apply the "Brand A" checkbox filter by clicking on the checkbox input. Wait 2 seconds, then uncheck the "Brand A" filter.
- Use the interactive price slider component to change price filtering.
- Success condition: The number of visible product cards must change after applying and removing the filter (e.g., 2 → 1 → 2).
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Do not hardcode visible text like "Category A" or "Product A" — use exact text or href values from html_data.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
