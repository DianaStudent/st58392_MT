You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the add-to-cart process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for applying a basic product filter using the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost:3000/category-a
Rules:
- Apply the "Brand A" checkbox filter by clicking on the checkbox input. Wait 2 seconds, then uncheck the "Brand A" filter.
- Use the interactive price slider component to change price filtering.
- Success condition: The number of visible product cards must change after applying and removing the filter (e.g., 2 → 1 → 2).
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
