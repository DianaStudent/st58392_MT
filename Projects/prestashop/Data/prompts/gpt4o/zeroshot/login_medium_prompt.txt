You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the login process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the login process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost:8080/en/
Credentials: "Email": "test@user.com", "Password": "test@user1"
Test scenario:
Test scenario:
1. Open the home page.
2. Click on the login link in the top menu.
3. Wait for the login page to load.
4. Fill in the email and password fields.
5. Submit the login form.
6. Verify that login was successful by checking for the presence of "Sign out" in the top bar.

Rules:
- Confirm success by checking that the text "Sign out" appear.
- Do not rely on dynamic ID values â€” use label or section attributes like data-name instead.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
