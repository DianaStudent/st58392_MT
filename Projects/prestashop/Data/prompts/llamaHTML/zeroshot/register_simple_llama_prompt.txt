You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structure 
and  for the 'register' process.

html_data: {html_data}

Task:
Generate a Python Selenium test that strictly follows the described process using only elements from the HTML structure .
Credentials: "Email": dynamically generated, "Password": "test@user1"
Rules:
- Fill all fields for registration and check chekboxes.
- Confirm success by checking that the text "Sign out" appear.
- Do not rely on dynamic ID values â€” use label or section attributes like data-name instead.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
