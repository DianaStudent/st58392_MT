You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the login process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the login process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost:8080/en/
Credentials: "Email": "test@user.com", "Password": "test@user1"
Rules:
- Confirm success by checking that the text "Sign out" appear.
- Do not rely on dynamic ID values â€” use label or section attributes like data-name instead.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
