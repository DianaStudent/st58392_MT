You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing detailed HTML structure 
and a textual description of UI screenshots for the 'addtocart-detailed' process.

html_data: {html_data}

screenshots_description: {screen_description}

Task:
Generate a Python Selenium test that strictly follows the described process using only elements from the HTML structure and visual layout.
URL: http://localhost/
Test scenario:
1. Open the home page.
2. Hover over the first product.
3. Click the revealed "Add to cart" button.
4. Click the cart icon to open the popup cart.
5. Wait for the popup to become visible.
6. Click "View cart" or similar button inside the popup.
7. On the cart page, verify that the product appears in the cart list.

Rules:
- Hover over a product item to reveal the "Add to cart" button.
- Open the cart popup by clicking the cart icon.
- Confirm success by checking that the popup contains at least one item.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
- Use presence_of_element_located to locate elements. Use visibility checks only when needed.
- Avoid hardcoded XPath text. Always derive selectors and conditions from html_data.
