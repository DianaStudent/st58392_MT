You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the user registration process.
Below is a dataset containing:
- HTML structure
- UI screenshots
- Previously generated Python test code
- Error traceback from the last test run
Task:
Fix or regenerate the Python Selenium unittest test for the registration process using the provided information.
html_data: {html_data}
previous_code: {previous_code}
error_traceback: {error_message}
URL: http://localhost/
Credentials to use:
- Email: dynamically generated, like test_xxxxxx@user.com
- Password: test**11
- firstname: Test
- lastname: User
Test scenario:
1. Open the home page.
2. Click on the account icon/button.
3. Select the "Register" option.
4. Wait for the registration page to load.
5. Fill in all fields: email, password, repeat password, first name, last name.
6. Select a first country from the dropdown and wait for region/state dropdown to load.
7. Select a first state only after selecting country and click on some place, to avoid country selector hide state selector.
8. Submit the form.
9. Wait for the page to redirect and confirm registration success by:
   - Checking if the URL contains "/my-account"
Rules:
- Fill all fields for registration.
- Confirm success by checking that the browser is redirected to a page containing "/my-account" in the URL.
- Do not rely on dynamic ID values â€” use label or section attributes like data-name instead.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
- Use presence_of_element_located to locate elements. Use visibility checks only when needed.
- Avoid hardcoded XPath text. Always derive selectors and conditions from html_data.
Return only Python code using unittest.
