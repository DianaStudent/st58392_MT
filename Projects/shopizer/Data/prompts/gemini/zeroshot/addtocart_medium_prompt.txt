You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the add-to-cart process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the add to cart process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost/
Test scenario:
1. Open the home page.
2. Hover over a product image to reveal the "Add to cart" button.
3. Click the "Add to cart" button.
4. Open the cart popup by clicking the cart icon.
5. Verify that at least one product is listed in the popup cart.

Rules:
- Hover over a product item to reveal the "Add to cart" button.
- Open the cart popup by clicking the cart icon.
- Confirm success by checking that the popup contains at least one item.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
