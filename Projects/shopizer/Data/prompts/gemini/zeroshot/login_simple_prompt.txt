You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the login process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the login process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost/
Credentials: Email: test2@user.com, Password: test**11
Rules:
- The test should click the account icon, then click the "Login" link to open the login form.
- Confirm success by checking that the browser is redirected to a page containing "/my-account" in the URL.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
