You are an expert in Selenium automation. Below is a dataset containing HTML structure and UI screenshots for the product filter process.
html_data: {html_data}
Task:
Generate a simple Python Selenium test for the product filter process based on the provided html_data and UI screenshots.
URL: http://localhost/
Test scenario:
1. Open the home page.
2. Click on the "Tables" tab to filter products.
3. Verify that at least one product appears.
4. Click on the "Chairs" tab to change the filter.
5. Verify that product list is updated.
6. Click "All" to remove the filter.
7. Confirm that the full list of products is shown.
Rules:
- Click on the filter tab.
- After filter is applied, check that at least one product is displayed.
- Success is when the product count changes after applying filters.
- Use attribute-based selectors, not dynamic IDs â€” rely on label text and section data-name values.
- Success is when the product count changes after applying and removing filters.
- Use webdriver-manager to manage ChromeDriver.
- Use selectors strictly from html_data.
- Use WebDriverWait with a timeout of 20 seconds before interacting with elements.
- Use unittest with setUp() and tearDown().
- Before asserting any element or text, check that it exists and is not empty.
- If any required element is missing, fail the test using self.fail(...).
Return only Python code using unittest.
